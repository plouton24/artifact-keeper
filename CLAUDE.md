## Code Style

Rust 1.75+: Follow standard conventions

## Git & GitHub

### Branch Protection — NEVER push directly to main

All changes must go through pull requests:

1. **Create a feature branch** from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git checkout -b feat/short-description   # or fix/, chore/, docs/
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit** to the feature branch

3. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/short-description
   gh pr create --fill   # or with --title and --body
   ```

4. **Merge via GitHub** after CI passes (squash merge preferred)

### Merge Requirements (MANDATORY)

**NEVER merge a PR unless ALL of the following are true:**

1. **CI workflow fully green.** Every check must pass: Rust check (clippy), unit tests, code coverage gate, duplication gate, security audit, CodeQL. No exceptions.
2. **Code coverage >= 70%** on new/changed lines. The CI coverage gate enforces this. If it fails, add tests until it passes.
3. **Code duplication <= 3%** on changed files. The CI duplication gate (jscpd) enforces this. If it fails, refactor duplicated code into shared helpers.
4. **No `--admin` bypass.** Do not use `gh pr merge --admin` to skip failing checks. If a gate is genuinely wrong (not a code issue), fix the gate first, get that fix merged, then rebase the PR.

If a CI gate is blocking a PR due to a systemic issue (e.g., the gate itself has a bug), **ask the user before bypassing.** Document why the bypass was needed and create a follow-up issue to fix the gate. This rule exists because bypassing gates erodes trust in the CI pipeline.

Branch naming conventions:
- `feat/` — new features
- `fix/` — bug fixes
- `chore/` — maintenance, dependencies, CI
- `docs/` — documentation only

### Parallel Agent Work (shallow clones)

When dispatching multiple agents to work on separate features or fixes in parallel, use **shallow clones in `/tmp/`** instead of git worktrees. Worktrees share the `.git` directory and agents end up switching branches in the main worktree, corrupting each other's state.

**Pattern for each agent:**
```bash
WORK_DIR="/tmp/$(uuidgen)-artifact-keeper"
git clone --depth 50 --branch main git@github.com:artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper.git "$WORK_DIR"
cd "$WORK_DIR"
git checkout -b feat/issue-description
# ... make changes, run checks, commit, push, create PR ...
rm -rf "$WORK_DIR"
```

Each agent gets a fully isolated repo copy. No shared state, no branch conflicts, no rust-analyzer cross-contamination. The agent must do ALL work inside `$WORK_DIR` and never touch the primary working directory at `/Users/khan/ak/artifact-keeper`.

### Pre-push Quality Checklist

Every commit must pass these checks locally before pushing. Do NOT use "push and see if CI passes" as a strategy.

```bash
cargo fmt --check                                          # formatting
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings      # linting
cargo test --workspace --lib                               # unit tests
```

Additionally, before pushing:
- **Code coverage**: new/changed lines MUST have >= 70% test coverage. The CI gate measures only lines you added or modified (not the entire file). Extract testable logic into pure helper functions to make handler code coverable.
- **Code duplication**: changed files MUST have <= 3% duplication (measured by jscpd). Extract repeated patterns into shared helpers. Common offenders: cache read/write patterns, test setup blocks, filter construction.
- Check migration numbering: verify the migration number is not already taken (`ls backend/migrations/ | tail -5`)
- If coverage or duplication gates will fail, fix them BEFORE pushing. Do not push and hope CI passes.

### Maintenance Branches

Long-lived `release/X.Y.x` branches exist for shipping bug fixes to older release series:

- **`release/1.0.x`** — maintenance branch for the 1.0 series (created from `v1.0.0-rc.5`)
- **`release/1.1.x`** — maintenance branch for the 1.1 series (created from `v1.1.2`)
- **`main`** — continues with 1.2.x (and beyond) development

**Bug fix workflow for maintenance branches:**
1. Create a fix branch from the maintenance branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/1.1.x && git pull
   git checkout -b fix/short-description
   ```
2. Push and create a PR **targeting `release/1.1.x`** (not main):
   ```bash
   git push -u origin fix/short-description
   gh pr create --base release/1.1.x --fill
   ```
3. Tag releases from the maintenance branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout release/1.1.x && git pull
   git tag v1.1.3 && git push origin v1.1.3
   ```
4. Cherry-pick fixes between maintenance and `main` so both lines stay in sync. Bug fixes typically land on the maintenance branch first, then cherry-pick forward to main.

**Docker image tags** (set by `docker/metadata-action` in `docker-publish.yml`):
- Version tags **strip the `v` prefix**: git tag `v1.1.0-rc.2` → Docker tag `:1.1.0-rc.2`
- `:latest` is only set for stable releases (no `-rc`, `-beta`, etc.)
- `:1.0`, `:1.1` series tags are set automatically via semver parsing
- `:dev` is only set for `main` branch pushes
- `:sha-<commit>` is set for every build

### Releases

- Release notes are **auto-generated by GitHub** (`generate_release_notes: true` in `release.yml`). They show the actual changelog (PRs merged, commits) since the previous tag.
- **Do NOT hardcode static release notes** in the workflow. No product descriptions, feature lists, or format counts in release bodies.
- The release workflow is at `.github/workflows/release.yml`, triggered by `v*` tags.
- The release-gate (artifact-keeper-test) must pass for a release to be published. If gates fail, the release is created as a **draft** with binaries attached but not published.

### Changelog and Release Notes

Every CHANGELOG entry and GitHub Release must include recognition sections. This is required for every release, no exceptions.

**Process when writing a changelog entry or release notes:**
1. Look at all PRs/commits since the last tag
2. For each fix, check the linked issue(s) to find who reported it
3. Check `gh pr list --state merged` for external PR authors (not `brandonrc` or bots)
4. Check the Sponsors section in README.md for current backers
5. Add a `### Thank You` section crediting external contributors who filed issues, reported bugs, or submitted PRs
6. Add a `### Sponsors` section thanking current backers by name and GitHub handle
7. **Do NOT include maintainer `brandonrc`** in the thank you section, only external contributors
8. If no external contributors reported issues for this release, omit the Thank You section
9. The Sponsors section is always included if there are active sponsors

**Example format in CHANGELOG.md:**
```markdown
## [1.x.x] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Sponsors

Thank you to our backers for supporting ongoing development:
- **Ash A.** ([@dragonpaw](https://github.com/dragonpaw))
- **Gabriel Rodriguez** ([@injectedfusion](https://github.com/injectedfusion))

[Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/artifact-keeper)

### Thank You
- @username for reporting the OCI auth issue behind reverse proxies (#123)
- @another-user for identifying the Maven SNAPSHOT re-upload bug (#456)
- @contributor for the SSO admin fix PR (#609)

### Added
...
```

**GitHub Release notes** follow the same structure. The release workflow auto-generates a changelog from merged PRs, but the Sponsors and Thank You sections must be prepended manually (or by the release script) before publishing.

### Other Git Rules

- **Do NOT add AI Co-Authored-By lines** (e.g., Claude, GPT) to commit messages — real human co-authors are fine
- **Do NOT include "Generated with Claude" or similar AI attribution** in PR descriptions
- **Always use `gh` CLI** for GitHub operations (PRs, issues, workflows, etc.)
  - Use `gh pr create` for pull requests
  - Use `gh issue` for issues
  - Use `gh workflow` for workflow operations
  - Do not use raw git commands for GitHub-specific features
- **Always use the PR template** when creating PRs with `gh pr create`. The template is at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Since `gh` does not auto-fill it, read the template and structure the `--body` to match its sections (Summary, Test Checklist, API Changes). Fill in checkboxes based on actual work done.

## Infrastructure & Cost Rules

- **NEVER build Docker images or compile code on EC2/cloud instances.** Cloud compute costs money. All builds must happen locally on the developer's MacBook or via GitHub Actions CI.
- **Demo EC2 instance** (`i-0caaf8acac6f85d4d`, Elastic IP `3.222.57.187`): Only pull pre-built images from `ghcr.io`, never `docker compose build`.
- **SSH access**: `ssh ubuntu@3.222.57.187` (uses local SSH key)
- **Demo stack**: Managed via systemd service `artifact-keeper-demo` and Caddy reverse proxy for TLS. Compose file at `/opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo/docker-compose.demo.yml`.
- **Demo version pinning**: Set `ARTIFACT_KEEPER_VERSION` in `/opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo/.env` to pin a release (e.g., `ARTIFACT_KEEPER_VERSION=1.1.0-rc.2`). Omit the `v` prefix — Docker tags use semver without `v`. Default is `latest` if unset.
- **Demo update procedure**: `ssh ubuntu@3.222.57.187`, edit `.env` with the desired version, then `cd /opt/artifact-keeper/deploy/demo && docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d`.
- **Docker images** are published to `ghcr.io/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-{backend,web,openscap}` by the Docker Publish CI workflow on every push to main and on release tags.
- **GitHub Pages site** (`/site/` directory): Combined landing page + Starlight docs, deployed to `artifactkeeper.com`.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This repo is the **Rust backend** (Axum API on `:8080`, gRPC on `:9090`). The
web UI is a separate repo (`artifact-keeper-web`). PostgreSQL 16 is the only
hard dependency for running the backend; OpenSearch, Trivy, OpenSCAP,
Dependency-Track, and Jaeger are optional (the backend degrades gracefully —
search falls back to Postgres, scans are skipped — when they are unreachable).
`AGENTS.md` is gitignored here, so these notes live in this file.

### Toolchain / build

- The workspace needs a Rust toolchain new enough for `edition2024` (stable
  ≥ 1.85). If `rustc` is 1.83 the build fails with an `edition2024` error — run
  `rustup default stable` first.
- Build/test/clippy must run with `SQLX_OFFLINE=true`. Query metadata is
  committed under `.sqlx/`, so no live database is needed to compile or run
  unit tests (`cargo test --workspace --lib`). Without it, `sqlx` tries to
  connect at compile time and fails.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` (the CI lint gate)
  currently reports a few pre-existing `redundant reference` /
  `useless_borrows_in_formatting` findings in **test** code in
  `backend/src/api/handlers/repositories.rs` under the newest stable clippy.
  These are pre-existing, not an env issue; library/binary clippy
  (`cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings`) is clean.

### Running the backend natively

- The backend auto-runs embedded SQLx migrations on startup and provisions an
  `admin` user from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` on first boot. It starts in a
  `SETUP_REQUIRED` state that gates mutations until the admin password is
  changed (via the UI or `POST /api/v1/users/<id>/password`).
- Do **not** source `.env.local-dev` verbatim: its `AK_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY` is
  an intentionally invalid base64 placeholder, and the backend calls
  `std::process::exit(1)` at boot when the key is set-but-invalid. Either leave
  `AK_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY` unset (only webhook create/rotate then 500) or set a
  real key: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
- `.env.local-dev` also points `DATABASE_URL` at port `30432` (the Compose
  Postgres). A native Postgres install listens on `5432`, so use
  `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://registry:registry@127.0.0.1:5432/artifact_registry`.
  Then `cargo run -p artifact-keeper-backend`. Docker (`scripts/dev.sh` /
  `docker-compose.local-dev.yml`) is the documented path but not required.
